Hello everyone! I'm excited to introduce you to my latest project - an application designed to explore PhonePe Pulse data.

## What is PhonePe pulse?

PhonePe Pulse is a first-of-its-kind product in India that showcases data about more than â‚¹. 2000+ crore transactions by consumers. It provides data-driven insights and trends from the Indian digital payments industry based on PhonePe transaction data across India. This dataset contains data from PhonePe Pulse, covering the years 2018-2022 across all quarters. It provides insights into digital payment trends and patterns in India during this time period.

# Lets get into the project!

## 1. Importing the required libraries
  First, Analyse all the data whcih is cloned from the github repository. Next import all the requried libraries for the project.

  you can use the below syntax to clone the repository from github,
  
  from git.repo.base import Repo
  
  Repo.clone_from("GitHub Clone URL","Path to get the cloned files")

## 2. Data Extraction:
  Extract the available data from the json file and convert it to the DataFrame, so that it can be easily uploaded in a sql database. 
  For this, I have used a nested for loop to extract all the data available.

## 3. Uploading the data into MySql:
  After extracting the data, establish a connection with the sql data base, here I have used MySql workbench.
  Create tables with the column names as per the Data frame we have created. Then, Insert the values from dataframe into the specified columns.

## 4. Again extract the data from mysql database and convert it into a data frame.
  By establishing a same connection to the database, we can convert the table available in the mysql database into Dataframes.

## 5. Use plotly express to analyse the data:
    Go through the data available, we can analyse and visualize it using plotly express.

## 6. Work on Streamlit to run the application:
  Install the streamlit package, Design the app as per your requriements.
